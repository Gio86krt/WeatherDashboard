# WeatherDashboard

- The app takes two inputs form the user: name of the city and a country from the select menu provided;

- Pressing the search button the iputs are read, a function checks if the inputs are valid, and using Openweather API a fetch call is made to retrieve the data;

- Once the promise is fulfilled the data is displayed in the right side of the viewport;

- On the left hand side a clickable list with the previous cities is inserted, the list is also stored in local storage, on click the correspondent city is searched again;

- On page reload the local storage is scanned for data, if some inputs are stored the list is inserted;
